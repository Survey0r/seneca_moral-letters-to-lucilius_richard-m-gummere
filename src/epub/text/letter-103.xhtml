			<h2>CIII. ON THE DANGERS OF ASSOCIATION WITH OUR FELLOW-MEN<sup id="calibre_link-204" class="reference"><a href="#calibre_link-203" type="noteref"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></h2>
</div>
<p><span class="wst-verse" id="calibre_link-4677"><sup class="reference"><b class="calibre32">1.</b></sup></span> Why are you looking about for troubles which may perhaps come your way, but which may indeed not come your way at all? I mean fires, falling buildings, and other accidents of the sort that are mere events rather than plots against us. Rather beware and shun those troubles which dog our steps and reach out their hands against us. Accidents, though they may be serious, are few&mdash;such as being shipwrecked or thrown from one’s carriage; but it is from his fellow-man that a man’s everyday danger comes. Equip yourself against that; watch that with an attentive eye. There is no evil more frequent, no evil more persistent, no evil more insinuating. <span class="wst-verse" id="calibre_link-4678"><sup class="reference"><b class="calibre32">2.</b></sup></span> Even the storm, before it gathers, gives a warning; houses crack before they crash; and smoke is the forerunner <span><span id="calibre_link-4679" data-page-number="189" data-page-name="Page:Ad Lucilium epistulae morales, volume 3.djvu/201" data-page-index="201" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:Ad_Lucilium_epistulae_morales,_volume_3.djvu/201"></span></span>of fire. But damage from man is instantaneous, and the nearer it comes the more carefully it is concealed.
</p><p>You are wrong to trust the countenances of those you meet. They have the aspect of men, but the souls of brutes; the difference is that only beasts damage you at the first encounter; those whom they have passed by they do not pursue. For nothing ever goads them to do harm except when need compels them: it is hunger or fear that forces them into a fight. But man delights to ruin man.
</p><p><span class="wst-verse" id="calibre_link-4680"><sup class="reference"><b class="calibre32">3.</b></sup></span> You must, however, reflect thus what danger you run at the hands of man, in order that you may deduce what is the duty of man. Try, in your dealings with others, to harm not, in order that you be not harmed. You should rejoice with all in their joys and sympathize with them in their troubles, remembering what you should offer and what you should withhold. <span class="wst-verse" id="calibre_link-4681"><sup class="reference"><b class="calibre32">4.</b></sup></span> And what may you attain by living such a life? Not necessarily freedom from harm at their hands, but at least freedom from deceit. In so far, however, as you are able, take refuge with philosophy: she will cherish you in her bosom, and in her sanctuary you shall be safe, or, at any rate, safer than before. People collide only when they are travelling the same path. <span class="wst-verse" id="calibre_link-4682"><sup class="reference"><b class="calibre32">5.</b></sup></span> But this very philosophy must never be vaunted by you; for philosophy when employed with insolence and arrogance has been perilous to many. Let her strip off your faults, rather than assist you to decry the faults of others. Let her not hold aloof from the customs of mankind, nor make it her business to condemn whatever she herself does not do. A man may be wise without parade and without arousing enmity. Farewell.
