			<h2>THE TEXT</h2>

<p>The manuscripts of the <i>Letters</i> fall into two clearly defined parts; from I. to LXXXVIII. inclusive, and from LXXXIX. to CXXIV. They are divided into books; but in this translation we shall number them only by letters. For a more detailed description the reader is referred to Hense’s preface to the 1914 Teubner edition.
</p><p>MSS. available for the first part of the <i>Letters</i> are&mdash;</p>
<div>(1) Two Paris MSS. of the 10th century, p and P.</div>
<div>(2) Another Paris MS. of the 11th century, b.</div>
<div>(3) The <i>codex Laurentianus</i>, of the 9th or 10th century, containing letters I.&ndash;LXV. This is designated as L.</div>
<div>(4) The <i>codex Venetus</i>, of the same date, containing Nos. LIII.&ndash;LXXXVIII. V.</div>
<div>(5) The <i>codex Metensis</i>, of the 11th century, known as M.</div>
<div>(6) The <i>codex Gudianus</i>, of the 10th century, which contains scraps of the earliest letters. Designated as g.</div>
<p>For the second part of the <i>Letters</i>, LXXXIX.&ndash;CXXIV., there is a more limited choice. The best MS. is&mdash;
</p>
<div><i>Codex Bambergensis</i>, of the 9th century, known as B.</div>
<div><i>Codex Argentoratensis</i>, A, which was destroyed in the siege of Strassburg, of the 9th or 10th century.</div>
<p>Other MSS., either of less importance or of later date, may be found in Hense’s preface.<sup id="calibre_link-1821" class="reference"><a href="#calibre_link-1820" type="noteref"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
