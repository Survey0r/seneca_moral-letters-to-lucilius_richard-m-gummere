			<h2>XXXV. ON THE FRIENDSHIP OF KINDRED MINDS</h2>
</div>
<p><span class="wst-verse" id="calibre_link-2824"><sup class="reference"><b class="calibre32">1.</b></sup></span> When I urge you so strongly to your studies, it is my own interest which I am consulting; I want your friendship, and it cannot fall to my lot unless you proceed, as you have begun, with the task of developing yourself.  For now, although you love me, you are not yet my friend. “But,” you reply, “are these words of different meaning?” Nay, more, they are totally unlike in meaning.<sup id="calibre_link-298" class="reference"><a href="#calibre_link-297" type="noteref"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> A friend loves you, of course; but one who loves you is not in every case your friend.  Friendship, accordingly, is always helpful, but love sometimes even does harm.  Try to perfect yourself, if for no other reason, in order that you may learn how to love.
</p><p><span class="wst-verse" id="calibre_link-2825"><sup class="reference"><b class="calibre32">2.</b></sup></span> Hasten, therefore, in order that, while thus perfecting yourself for my benefit, you may not have <span><span id="calibre_link-2826" data-page-number="245" data-page-name="Page:Ad Lucilium epistulae morales, volume 1.djvu/269" data-page-index="269" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:Ad_Lucilium_epistulae_morales,_volume_1.djvu/269"></span></span>learned perfection for the benefit of another.  To be sure, I am already deriving some profit by imagining that we two shall be of one mind, and that whatever portion of my strength has yielded to age will return to me from your strength, although there is not so very much difference in our ages.  <span class="wst-verse" id="calibre_link-2827"><sup class="reference"><b class="calibre32">3.</b></sup></span> But yet I wish to rejoice in the accomplished fact.  We feel a joy over those whom we love, even when separated from them, but such a joy is light and fleeting; the sight of a man, and his presence, and communion with him, afford something of living pleasure; this is true, at any rate, if one not only sees the man one desires, but the sort of man one desires. Give yourself to me, therefore, as a gift of great price, and, that you may strive the more, reflect that you yourself are mortal, and that I am old.  <span class="wst-verse" id="calibre_link-2828"><sup class="reference"><b class="calibre32">4.</b></sup></span> Hasten to find me, but hasten to find yourself first.  Make progress, and, before all else, endeavour to be consistent with yourself.  And when you would find out whether you have accomplished anything, consider whether you desire the same things to-day that you desired yesterday.  A shifting of the will indicates that the mind is at sea, heading in various directions, according to the course of the wind.  But that which is settled and solid does not wander from its place.  This is the blessed lot of the completely wise man, and also, to a certain extent, of him who is progressing and has made some headway.  Now what is the difference between these two classes of men?  The one is in motion, to be sure, but does not change its position; it merely tosses up and down where it is; the other is not in motion at all.  Farewell.
